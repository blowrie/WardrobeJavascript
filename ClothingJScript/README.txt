THURSDAY CONTENT REQUIREMENT
The Home Page starts with out weekly assignment.  
An advertisment plays and when it ends and when the video
finishes an alert pops up that says thanks for watching this ad

if you scroll down there is a button on check out that takes
you to your closet

REMOVE CONTENT REQUIREMENT
On the right side there is a gif advertisment that has a button
to click and removes the add.  This is my remove content section

ADD CONTENT REQUIREMENT
Underneath there is a option to add a clothing item to your wish list
I had to double click this the first time for it to work, but clicking on the div
makes it swap to an action form where you can add an item name, brand, and price.
This is my add content section 

ARRAY IN JAVASCIPT FUNCTION REQUIREMENT & STRETCH TASK
In the dropdown menu You can select your favorite brand.
I used a java script function that uses an array to populate the
menu.  The problem is that because it is onclick it happens everytime you click
so the list continues to get longer.  I did alot of research and saw that you can 
use JQUERY to .one(click, funtion) to make it so the function only works the first time
the button is click.  I tried to implement it but couldn't figure out what needed to go where
excited to learn this week. 

ENLARGE AND SWITCH TEXT IN FOOTER REQUIREMENT
On the bottom of the page the copyright tag switches to created by when you mouse over.
it works much much much better if you go very slow. Too fast and it
looks like it is freaking out. 

Clothing Tab:

This is Where the clothes are found from the database

INFORMING AND DIRECTING A USER TO A DIFFERENT SITE 
The add to your collection takes you to nike.com where you can shop for new clothes.  Before 
you are directed to the new site it prompts for ok or cancel.  If the user clicks ok nike.com
opens up in a new tab.  

THE SORT REQUIREMENT 
I struggled with this trying to figure out how to pass a razor variable from my index into
the javascript page.  If this was possible the if statements and javascript would be effective.
I left all the code so that if I learn how to pass the variable It will be a simple one line and work.
